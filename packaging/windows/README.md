# Windows Microsoft Store packaging

This directory turns the Compose Desktop Windows app image into the unsigned
MSIX artifacts accepted by Partner Center. Microsoft signs the package after
certification, so this build does not use a PFX, certificate, HSM, or signing
secret.

## Product identity

These values came from the Partner Center Product identity page and are
case-sensitive:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Package identity name | SudosyLabs.Vnidrop |
| Publisher | CN=6456DC8E-2C31-44BD-AACC-2E6813C833CB |
| Publisher display name | Sudosy Labs |
| Reserved Store name | Vnidrop |
| Application ID | VniDrop |
| Store ID | 9NJ5Q0FG7TGL |

The package identity name, publisher, and Application ID must remain stable
after the first release. The manifest display name uses the exact reserved Store
name; the product's in-app branding and launcher remain `VniDrop`.

The initial package targets Windows Desktop x64, Windows 10 version 2004
(build 19041) or later. The fourth MSIX version component is reserved by the
Store, so app version 1.2.3 becomes package version 1.2.3.0.

## GitHub Actions

The Windows Store package workflow runs automatically for relevant pull
requests, for release tags matching vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, and by manual dispatch.
Pull requests build and validate without retaining an artifact. Tags and manual
runs retain:

- VniDrop_VERSION_x64.msix
- VniDrop_VERSION_x64.msixupload
- build metadata
- SHA-256 checksums

The preferred Partner Center upload is the msixupload file. It is an upload
envelope containing the x64 MSIX. The MSIX is intentionally unsigned and is not
a public sideloading artifact. Do not attach it to a public GitHub Release
unless an independent production-signing path is added.

The workflow explicitly selects Gobley's release Rust variant and rejects a
package containing the debug native JAR. It also verifies the bundled JVM,
vnidrop.dll, app version, manifest identity, architecture, and launcher after
MakeAppx unpacks the finished package.

## First Store release

Microsoft's current GitHub Actions publishing flow is for updates to an
already-live free product. For the first release:

1. Run this workflow from a release tag or by manual dispatch.
2. Download the retained artifact.
3. Test that exact build on an interactive Windows VM. Local installation needs
   an ephemeral development signature trusted only by that VM; this is not a
   production signing key.
4. Upload the msixupload file to the current Partner Center draft.
5. Confirm that Partner Center parses the expected identity, version, x64
   architecture, Windows.Desktop target, en-US language, and runFullTrust
   capability.
6. Complete listing, screenshots, certification notes, and submit.

Use this restricted-capability justification in Submission options:

> VniDrop is a classic JVM desktop application that loads its bundled native
> Rust and JVM libraries and needs normal user-level filesystem and network
> access to transfer user-selected files directly between devices.

After the first release is certified and live, Store publication can be added
as a separate protected job. Keep its Partner Center credentials in a GitHub
Environment, not in this build job:

- AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID
- AZURE_AD_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID
- AZURE_AD_APPLICATION_SECRET
- SELLER_ID

The Store ID is a non-secret variable.

## Manual build on Windows

From the repository root:

~~~powershell
.\gradlew.bat :shared:jvmTest :desktopApp:createReleaseDistributable -Pvnidrop.version=1.0.0 -Pvnidrop.desktop.rustVariant=release -Pvnidrop.diagnostics.included=false --no-daemon --no-configuration-cache --stacktrace

.\packaging\windows\build-msix.ps1 -Version 1.0.0 -AppImage .\desktopApp\build\compose\binaries\main-release\app\VniDrop -OutputDirectory .\build\release\windows
~~~

The packaging script requires Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0. It uses MakePri to
index the scale-qualified visual assets, then MakeAppx with SHA-256 block maps
and manifest validation enabled.
